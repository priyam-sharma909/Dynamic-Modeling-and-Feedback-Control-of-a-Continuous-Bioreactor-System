Control for Bioreactor (Chemostat) System
This repository contains MATLAB files for:

Open-loop simulation of the bioreactor
FOPTD model building
Closed-loop control (P/PI/PID) of 3 output variables
1. Open-Loop Simulation
Folder: Open Loop
Run the files in this folder to simulate the nonlinear dynamics of the bioreactor (chemostat).

Outputs:

Biomass concentration X
Substrate concentration S
Product concentration P
These responses are used as data for model identification.

2. FOPTD Models
Folder: FOPTD Models
Builds three types of FOPTD models for the bioreactor:

Nonlinear fmincon-based FOPTD model
Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based FOPTD model
Reaction Curve method-based FOPTD model (most accurate and used for controller tuning)
3. Closed-Loop Control
Folder: Closed Loop Model
Uses the selected FOPTD models to design and simulate:

P controller
PI controller
PID controller
for all three output variables (X, S, P).

Results
Simulation and control results are documented in the attached presentation with detailed explanations.
